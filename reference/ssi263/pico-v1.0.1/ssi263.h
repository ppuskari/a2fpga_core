/* ssi263 -- the engine's SSI-263 chip model in portable C99.

   A line-by-line port of ssi263/chip.py (engine v0.10), which stays the reference:
   research and tuning happen there, and tools/check_native_core.py holds this port to
   it (request timing and chip time exact, audio within float noise, PCM identical).
   This core is what the NVDA add-ons run, and what a SAPI or Linux front end would.

   The host writes registers (ssi263_write), watches the A/R request (ssi263_request),
   and pulls audio at its own rate (ssi263_run, ssi263_run_until_request).  The chip
   knows phoneme codes, never words; the ROM table and every parameter come from the
   caller (ssi263/native.py builds them from params.py and data/rom_bits.csv). */
